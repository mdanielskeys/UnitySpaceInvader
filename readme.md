# Unity Space Invader

## Overview

This is my first Unity project that I set out on my own. The actual first was the 2D tutorial. I wanted this to be a complete game. Therefore it has levels, music, SFX, score, multiple lives, and a game over screen.

It isn't necessarily a good game, and it is certainly derivitive of the original Space Invaders. The objective though was to learn Unity. To that end I think it is a good start.

# Thoughts

I still don't think I've discovered an efficient way for Unity objects to talk to each other. I feel like there are are too many global settings, or things controlling or having control over objects where they have no business doing it. I hope that as I continue to study this Unity structure more that I can figure out a better way to manage the game objects so that it feels less like a free for all.

# Next Steps

I think it would be fun to have a high score screen that uses a web service to keep high scores in the cloud.

# Music

The music in the application, SpaceRun, was written by me. I kind of slapped it together, but it fits the mood of the game nicely. Also, it is repetitive but doesn't necessarily become annoying. This is especially true for the ten to twenty minutes that the game remains fun. I look forward to writting more game music for up coming projects.
